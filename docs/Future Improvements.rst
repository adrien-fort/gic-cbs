Future Improvements
===================

Here is a list of potential improvements for the GIC Cinema Booking System:

1) Allow for booking cancellation/rebooking
2) Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction
3) Allow for inputting multiple movies and switching between them (implement a data store)
4) Add more advanced seat selection algorithms (e.g., social distancing, group seating)
5) Allow users to pick several seats individually rather than a block
